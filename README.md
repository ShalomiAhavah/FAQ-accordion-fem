## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Less Css compiler
- Git



### What I learned

 - I enjoyed learning more about css selectors. I will continue using css over javascript any day

```css
details[open] .icon {
    background-image: url(/assets/images/icon-minus.svg); 
}
```




### Continued development

 - JavaScript. I absolutely suck at it.
